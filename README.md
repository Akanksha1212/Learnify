# Learnify

Globally, according to Dyslexia International(2017) between 5-10% of the population experience dyslexia, which equates to around 700 million people worldwide. There are many problems like reading, writing, memory, and organizational difficulties that they face which makes day-to-day life difficult. Due to Covid, it has been difficult for all students to transition to online classes and we can imagine how difficult it would have been for kids with learning disabilities. Parents working from home can not give proper time to kids and help them with their studies. It's tough for teachers as well to have 1-1 interaction with kids and give them the attention they need. This all is affecting the learning experience for a lot of kids worldwide and making the lives of kids with learning disabilities miserable.
